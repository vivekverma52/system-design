1. Functional Requirements (Expanded for Marketplace)
Requirement	Description
User Management	Users can register as buyers or sellers. Sellers require verification.
Product Listings	Sellers can create, edit, and manage listings for digital products (e-books, software, courses, etc.).
Shopping Cart & Checkout	Buyers can add products to a cart and purchase them in a single, secure transaction.
Payment Processing	Secure integration with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions.
Digital Delivery	Upon successful payment, the system automatically grants the buyer access to the digital product (e.g., sends a download link, license key, or access to a private area).
Order Management	Buyers and sellers can view order history and status.
Reviews & Ratings	Buyers can leave reviews and ratings for products they've purchased.
Search & Discovery	Users can browse and search for products with filters (category, price, rating).
Notifications	Real-time notifications for orders, messages, reviews, and platform updates.
2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Requirement	Description
Security	Critical. All payment data must be PCI DSS compliant. User data and digital products must be secure.
Reliability	The payment and digital delivery process must be highly reliable. A failed delivery after payment is a critical issue.
Consistency	Payment and order fulfillment workflows require strong consistency to prevent double-charging or selling non-existent inventory.
Scalability	Handle traffic spikes (e.g., during a popular product launch or a seasonal sale).
Low Latency	Product search and browsing should be fast. The checkout flow must be seamless.
3. High-Level Architecture & Data Flow
We'll use a microservices architecture to ensure separation of concerns, independent scalability, and resilience.

Core Services:
API Gateway: Single entry point for all client requests. Handles authentication, rate limiting, and routes requests to the appropriate microservice.

User Service: Manages user profiles, authentication, and roles (Buyer/Seller/Admin).

Product Service: Handles CRUD operations for product listings, categories, and inventory (for products with limited licenses).

Search Service: Indexes product data and serves fast search queries (implemented with Elasticsearch or OpenSearch).

Order Service: Manages the shopping cart and the order lifecycle (Created -> Paid -> Fulfilled -> Completed).

Payment Service: Orchestrates communication with external payment gateways (Stripe). This service must be highly secure and isolated.

Delivery Service: Handles the logic for granting access to a digital product upon successful payment (e.g., generating a unique download URL, sending an email with access instructions, calling a webhook).

Notification Service: Sends emails, SMS, and in-app notifications via message queues.

Why the Webhook? Using a webhook from Stripe is more reliable than relying on the client to confirm the payment success. It prevents scenarios where the client's connection drops after paying but before confirming with our server.

4. Data Modeling & Database Selection
Data Entity	Recommended DB	Reasoning & Schema Notes
User Profiles	SQL (PostgreSQL)	Structured data. Relationships are important (e.g., User has many Orders). Needs strong consistency.
Product Catalog	NoSQL (MongoDB/DynamoDB)	Semi-structured data. Products can have different attributes (e.g., a software key vs. an ebook). Scales well for reads.
Orders & Transactions	SQL (PostgreSQL)	Mandatory. Requires ACID compliance. Financial data must be accurate and consistent.
Product Search Index	Elasticsearch	Built for fast, complex full-text search and filtering. Denormalized data from the Product Service.
Shopping Carts	In-Memory (Redis)	Ephemeral data. Requires fast read/write access and can be expired automatically.
Download Links/Access Keys	SQL or NoSQL	Should be stored securely. Can include an expiration timestamp and a unique, unguessable token.
5. Critical Considerations & Deep Dives
a. Secure Payment Processing
Never handle raw PCI data. Offload all payment processing to a certified provider like Stripe or Braintree.

Use their frontend libraries (e.g., Stripe Elements) to tokenize card information on the client-side. Your server only ever sees a token, not a card number.

The Payment Service uses the token and the Stripe API to create a charge.

b. Reliable Digital Delivery
This is the core value proposition. The flow must be fault-tolerant.

Implement retry logic in the Delivery Service if a step fails (e.g., email fails to send).

Use idempotent operations to ensure that a single payment event doesn't result in multiple product deliveries (e.g., sending two license keys for one purchase). Stripe webhook events can be retried, so your service must handle duplicates safely.

c. Scalable Search
The Product Service should publish events (e.g., "ProductCreated", "ProductUpdated") to a message queue (Kafka).

A dedicated Indexing Service consumes these events and updates the search index in Elasticsearch. This decouples the write path (creating a product) from the read path (searching products), ensuring search performance doesn't impact seller activities.

d. Security
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure sellers can only edit their own products and buyers can only see their own orders.

Secure File Storage: Digital products stored in object storage (S3) should be served through pre-signed URLs that expire after a short time. This prevents unauthorized sharing of download links.

API Security: Use JWT tokens for authentication between the client and API Gateway, and mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between internal microservices.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for a platform like Whop.com. The use of managed services for payments (Stripe) and search (Elasticsearch) allows the development team to focus on building core business logic rather than infrastructure.
